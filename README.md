# WPMassDetector
A simple bash script that takes a list of websites and tells you which ones uses WordPress CMS

# Usage
  1. Clone this repo.
  2. change directory to the new created directory named WPMassDetector 
  3. Copy your websites url's to the file named sites.
  3. chmod 775 WPMassDetector.sh
  4. ./WPMassDetector.sh sites WPsites.txt
  
# Notes
  1. This is an ugly script that I coded to automate a certain task.
  2. If your websites list is long, then it will take some time to process it.
  3. I will add Jommla and other CMS detection later.
  4. Feel free to edit it.
